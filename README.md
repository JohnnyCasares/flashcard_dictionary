# Flashcard Cictionary
Converts romaji to hiragana and stores it in a txt file for the purpose of learning and practicing the writing system used in Japan

## Overview

The Romaji to Hiragana Converter is a C program that allows users to input Romaji (Japanese in Roman characters) words and converts them to Hiragana, the phonetic script used in Japanese writing. Additionally, the program provides an option for users to store new words and their definitions in a text file for future reference.

## Features

- **Romaji to Hiragana Conversion:** Users can enter Romaji words, and the program will convert them to their corresponding Hiragana characters, aiding in learning Japanese pronunciation.

- **Word Storage:** The program enables users to add new Romaji words and their definitions to a text file. If the word already exists in the file, the program will display its stored definition.

## Usage

1. Compile the C program using a C compiler:


2. Run the executable:
./main


3. Follow the prompts to input Romaji words for conversion or word storage.

## Word Storage File

The program stores new words and their definitions in a text file called "dict.txt." Each entry in the file follows the format:
sushi: A Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice topped with raw fish or other ingredients.
ramen: A Japanese dish of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat or fish-based broth.
